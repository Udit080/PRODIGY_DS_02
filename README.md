TASK-02

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.


ANSWER AND ANALYSIS:

1)Age distribution: The age distribution appears to be right-skewed, with most passengers being between 20 and 40 years old.
2)Fare by Passenger Class: First-class passengers paid significantly higher fares than second and third-class passengers. There's a clear relationship between passenger class and fare.
3)Gender distribution: There are more male passengers than female passengers in the dataset.
4)Age vs Fare: There's a slight positive correlation between age and fare, particularly for first-class passengers. Older passengers tend to pay higher fares.
5)Embarkation points: Most passengers embarked from Southampton, followed by Cherbourg and then Queenstown.
Correlation analysis:

There's a strong positive correlation between Pclass and Fare.
There's a moderate negative correlation between Pclass and Age, suggesting that higher-class passengers tend to be older.
There's a weak positive correlation between SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (number of parents/children aboard).



These insights provide a good starting point for understanding the Titanic dataset. Further analysis could involve more advanced statistical techniques or machine learning models to predict survival rates based on these features.
